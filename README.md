Generated RSA pub/priv key with a seed string (Using bip39 isn't a bad idea ;-)

## Features

To secure things, RSA key pair is still a good idea, but it's not really user friendly
Handling it with the same idea as bitcoin do, generating it from a uuid size seed.

Key pair is generated by 2048 deterministic derivation using sha512
Then creating every BigInt needed by writing in a string the next derivation until the string fit our key size need

## Usage

Creating the generator with a seed:
~~~
final seededRSA = SeededRSA(mnemonnic);
~~~

Calling the generating process
~~~
await seededRSA.generate()
~~~

## Disclaimer

This library isn't tested or review
Do not used it, or do the review/evaluation yourself ;-)
